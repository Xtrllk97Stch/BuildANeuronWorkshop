Taking the exam ....
For this datapoint, the feature values are F1 = 4.0, F2 = -3.0.
The target value is predicted to be -4.000, so the masked value would be -1, and the label should be "McCoy".
The real target value is -1.0, and the real label is "McCoy".
That is correct!

For this datapoint, the feature values are F1 = -4.0, F2 = 7.0.
The target value is predicted to be 5.240, so the masked value would be 1, and the label should be "Hatfield".
The real target value is 1.0, and the real label is "Hatfield".
That is correct!

For this datapoint, the feature values are F1 = -2.0, F2 = -2.0.
The target value is predicted to be 0.460, so the masked value would be 1, and the label should be "Hatfield".
The real target value is 1.0, and the real label is "Hatfield".
That is correct!

For this datapoint, the feature values are F1 = 2.0, F2 = 2.0.
The target value is predicted to be -0.740, so the masked value would be -1, and the label should be "McCoy".
The real target value is -1.0, and the real label is "McCoy".
That is correct!

Taking the exam ....
For this datapoint, the feature values are F1 = -1.0, F2 = -1.0, F3 = -1.0, F4 = -1.0, F5 = -1.0, F6 = -1.0, F7 = -1.0, F8 = -1.0, F9 = -1.0, F10 = -1.0, F11 = -1.0, F12 = 1.0, F13 = 1.0, F14 = 1.0, F15 = -1.0, F16 = -1.0, F17 = 1.0, F18 = 1.0, F19 = 1.0, F20 = -1.0, F21 = -1.0, F22 = 1.0, F23 = 1.0, F24 = 1.0, F25 = -1.0.
The target value is predicted to be 0.561, so the masked value would be 1, and the label should be "friend".
The real target value is 1.0, and the real label is "friend".
That is correct!
